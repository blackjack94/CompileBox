## What is it? ##
CompileBox is a *Docker* based sandbox to run untrusted code and return the output to your app.

The original project is [here][1], which is demo at these 2 sites:

 - Basic Example: [compile.remoteinterview.io][2]
 - Prettified View: [codepad.remoteinterview.io][3]

This is an adapted version for my Capstone project (ThinkCode).
